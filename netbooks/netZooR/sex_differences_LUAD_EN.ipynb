    "## 1. Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been observed to have significant sex differences in incidence risk, prognosis and response to therapy. While females have much higher chance of developing the disease compared to males, males have poorer survival outcome[1]. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these disparities have not been investigated extensively. \n",
    "We use sample-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) methods PANDA[2] and LIONESS[3] to construct sample-specific GRNs using RNA sequencing data from lung adenocarcinoma primary tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)[4] to identify genes and biological processes that are differentially targeted by transcription factors (TF) between males and femlaes. Uniformly processed RNA-Seq data along with information on clinical covariates for LUAD tumors from TCGA were downloaded from the Recount3 database on May 26, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "PANDA and LIONESS algorithms were used to construct individual sample-specific gene regulatory networks using Python package netZooPy version 0.9.10[7]. In addition to the gene expression data, two other data sources were utilized to construct the regulatory networks: Transcription factor/target gene regulatory prior (derived by mapping Transcription factor motifs from the Catalog of Inferred Sequence Binding Preferences (CIS-BP)[8] to the promoter of target genes) and protein-protein interaction (using the interaction scores from StringDb v11.5[9] between all Transcription factor in the regulatory prior).\n",
    "\n",
    "The networks are publicly available on the GRAND database[5]: https://grand.networkmedicine.org/downloads/ and can be found under the search term “sexDiffLUAD”. In this notebook we compare the indegree (i.e. the sum of all incoming edges from all TFs to a particular gene) of genes computed for every sample-specific network from males and females, while adjusting for clinical covariates: age at diagnosis, race, smoking status and tumor stage. We perform a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the list of biological processes obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database[6].\n",
